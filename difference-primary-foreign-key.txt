Problem 4.Difference between a Primary and Foreign Key
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and provide an information about primary and foreign 
keys in the RDBMS Systems. What is the primary key? Why do we need it? What is the foreign key? 
What is the purpose of foreign keys? What is the difference between a primary and foreign key? Write 
in a text file called "difference-primary-foreign-key.txt".

Primary key
-	Primary key is main index (uniquely identifies) each record in a database table.  This is main 
tool for relation between two tables or more tables! He is prevents recurrence in database.  
A primary key column cannot contain NULL values.
Foreign key
-	Foreign key is index ( identifies ) in the table for link for Primary key in another table. This is 
way for relation.
If not have Foreign key and Primary key We can't make relation between two tables and can't prevent 
repeat of data.
