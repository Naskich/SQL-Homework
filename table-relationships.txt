Problem 5. Relationships between Tables in Relational 
Databases
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and provide an information about table relationships in 
relational databases. Provide more information about every relationship type (one-to-many, many-to-
many, many-to-one, one-to-one, others). Write in a text file called "table-relationships.txt". 
Relations are links form one or more tables in another tables in relational database!
one-to-one
-	 A row in a table is associated to one and only one row in another table.  An example of a 
one-to-one relationship is a person can have one social security number and a social security 
number can only be assigned to one person. In most cases there is no need for a one-to-one 
relationship as the contents of the two tables can be combined into one table.
One-to-many
-	The most common relationship used when creating relational databases.  A row in a table in 
a database can be associated with one or  more rows in another table. An example of a one-
to-many relationship is a single order has many items on that order. 
Many-to-many
-	When one or more rows in a table are associated with one or more rows in another 
table.  An example of a many-to-many relationship is a table of customers who can purchase 
many different products and a table of products that can be purchased by many different 
customers.
