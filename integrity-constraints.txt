Problem 8. Database Integrity Constraints
Explain the database integrity constrains. What are the constraint types? When are they used? Provide 
definition for all of them (primary key constraint, unique key constraint, foreign key constraint, others). 
Write in a text file called "integrity-constraints.txt".
Type of constrains
-	Type of constrains are:  Database integrity constrains, Primary key constraint, foreign key 
constraint.
Database integrity constrains
-	Database integrity constrains are rules which cannot to allow incorrectly fill in tables. They 
are tool and objects for regulatory of filling in table in  database. 
Primary key constraint
-	The Primary constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. Primary keys 
must contain  unique values.
Foreign key constraint
-	There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade 
delete related rows. These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.
Unique key constraint
-	The unique constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. The unique and 
primary key constraints both provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of 
columns. primary key constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint defined on it.
