Problem 11. Transactions
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and provide a basic information about database 
transactions and their application? What is ACID transaction? What is transaction log? Write in a text 
file called "transactions.txt".
ACID transaction
-	In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. ACID is 
a set of properties that guarantee the reliable processing of data through use of transactions. A 
transaction is a unit of work performed within a database that consists of a sequence of 
operations, which is treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. 
For many use cases and applications it is important that several operations can be grouped in 
such a unit so that it's executed together.
Database transactions
-	Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes: 
To provide accurate and reliable transactions that allow correct recovery from failures and 
keeping the database consistent even in cases of hardware or software failures. To provide 
isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. If this isolation is not provided, 
the program's outcome is possibly erroneous.
Transaction log
-	Every SQL Server database has a transaction log that records all transactions and the database 
modifications made by each transaction. The transaction log must be truncated on a regular 
basis to keep it from filling up. However, some factors can delay log truncation, so monitoring 
log size is important. Some operations can be minimally logged to reduce their impact on 
transaction log size.
-	The transaction log is a critical component of the database and, if there is a system failure, the 
transaction log might be required to bring your database back to a consistent state. The 
transaction log should never be deleted or moved unless you fully understand the ramifications 
of doing this.
