Problem 1. What Database Models do You Know?
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide an 
information about different type of database models. Provide detailed 
information about one of the database models by your choice, different 
from the relational model. Write in a text file called "database-
models.txt". Use English.

Today in the world use different type database models. The database 
models are data logical models for database include - Network Model, 
Relational model, Object Model, Document Model, Hierarchical Model, Star 
Shema, Entry relational Model.  In practice most use Relational model, 
which has relationships between tables. 
Network Model 
- Network model is flexible model for presentation of the database. He is 
adds Hierarchical Mode, which has tree structure of presentation and 
records database, but main different form Hierarchical Mode is Graph 
structure in Network model. A graph data structure consists of a finite  
set of vertices or nodes or point. While the hierarchical database model 
structures data as a tree of records, with each record having one parent 
record and many children, the network model allows each record to have 
multiple parent and child records, forming a generalized graph structure. 
Network model was created form Charles Bachman in USA .
