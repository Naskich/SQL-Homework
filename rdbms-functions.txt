Problem 2.	Which are the Main Functions Performed by a RDBMS?
Perform a research (e.g. Google or Wikipedia) and provide an information 
about the relational database management systems and their main 
functions. Write in a text file called "rdbms-functions.txt". Use 
English.
RDBMS
- RDBMS is abbreviation form Relational Database Management System 
(servers). The most popular RDBMS are - Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle 
Database, My SQL, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, SQLite. Main features of RDBMS are

easy support of data, Database mirroring. In top 3 of RDBMS are Microsoft 
SQL Server, Oracle Database Server , My SQL Server.

Main  Function RDBMS
- Oracle Database 
Oracle works to efficiently manage its resource, a database of 
information, among the multiple clients requesting and sending data in 
the network. It is an excellent database server choice for client/server 
computing. Functions of Oracle Database are - locking mechanisms,

SQL, Self-managing database,  high security - but unfortunately very 
expensive is database servers !

- My SQL Server

Microsoft Inc. Its primary query languages are: T-SQL and ANSI SQL. 
Functions of MS SQL server are - High Performance, High Availability, 
Database mirroring, DDL triggers, Ranking functions, XML integration.
